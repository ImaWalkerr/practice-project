How to run website with Docker:
-------------

### For Windows

##### Check Requirements for Hyper-V
Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, or Education
64-bit Processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT).
CPU support for VM Monitor Mode Extension (VT-c on Intel CPUs).
Minimum of 4 GB memory.
The Hyper-V role cannot be installed on Windows 10 Home.

##### Check Requirements for WSL-2
Windows 10 version 2004 or higher (build 19041 or higher) or Windows 11.

- You need to activate [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v) 
and then install and activate [WSL-2](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/wsl/install)
- You need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (put mark use `WSL-2 configuration`)
or you can use plugin in your [IDE](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2017/08/using-docker-compose-on-windows-in-pycharm/) (PyCharm for example)
- where you need to choose .exe file.

For Windows in Dockerfile:
change line - `RUN pip install -r requirements.txt`
to line - `RUN pip install -r requirements_windows.txt`

- In the `Terminal` use command to create and start containers:
```sh
docker-compose build
```
if you want to make changes in docker-compose and accept them use command:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

### For Linux OS

- You need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
or you can use plugin in your IDE - where you need to choose docker file.

- In the `Terminal` use command to create and start containers:
```sh
sudo docker-compose build
```
if you want to make changes in docker-compose and accept them use command:
```sh
sudo dockerâ€“compose up
```

How to run website local:
-------------

`Warning!`
**If you use** `Windows 10 PRO` >>>
Install dependencies from the requirements_windows.txt:
```sh
pip install requirements_windows.txt
```
`Warning!`
**If you use** `Linux OS` >>>
Install dependencies from the requirements.txt:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After cloning repository and downloading dependencies 
you need to set environmental variables connected to:

[PostgreSQL](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#databases) 
(`PostgreSQL` **is the default here):**
- DATABASE_ENGINE
- DATABASE_NAME
- DATABASE_USER
- DATABASE_PASSWORD
- DATABASE_HOST
- DATABASE_PORT

[Email confirmation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/email/#send-mail):
- EMAIL_BACKEND
- EMAIL_HOST 
- EMAIL_PORT 
- EMAIL_USE_TLS
- EMAIL_HOST_USER 
- EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD

**If you want** to get email confirmation email local >>>
put this line in your `settings.py`

- EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'


[Twitch](https://www.igdb.com/api) IGDB API:

- IGDB_CLIENT_ID
- IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET

[Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) API

Now you're ready to run the `server`:

You can use **Edit configuration** for your `manage.py` and 
put `runserver` in parameters and apply changes.
After that you can start server just click on `green arrow` and you good to go!
